# Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to guide AI models to produce desired outputs. It's a critical skill for effectively leveraging large language models without requiring model retraining. This section explores various techniques for crafting effective prompts, including clear instructions, context provision, and structured formatting. We'll examine how different prompt structures can dramatically affect model responses, discuss best practices for specific use cases, and explore advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot learning. Mastering prompt engineering allows users to unlock the full potential of AI models while maintaining control over their outputs.

Effective prompts often follow specific patterns such as providing clear context, defining the desired output format, specifying constraints, and including examples when appropriate. We'll explore how to create system prompts for consistent behavior, how to structure complex multi-step tasks, and how to handle edge cases. The section will also cover evaluation strategies for prompt effectiveness, iteration techniques for improvement, and methods for creating robust prompts that work across different scenarios and model versions.
