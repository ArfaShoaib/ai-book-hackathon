# 🏗️ Building AI Projects

:::info Complete Project Lifecycle
Building successful AI projects requires a systematic approach that combines **technical expertise** with **project management best practices**. This section covers the complete lifecycle from problem identification through deployment and maintenance.

## Phase 1: Problem Formulation

:::note Getting Started Right
- Define clear business objectives
- Assess feasibility and resource requirements
- Identify success metrics
- Establish baseline performance
- Plan data requirements
:::

## Phase 2: Data Management

**Critical Success Factors:**
- 📊 **Data Collection** - Gather quality datasets aligned with objectives
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values, outliers, errors
- 📈 **Data Preprocessing** - Normalize, encode, augment data
- 🔀 **Dataset Versioning** - Track changes to maintain reproducibility
- ⚖️ **Bias Detection** - Identify and address potential biases

:::warning Data Quality is Paramount
Garbage in, garbage out—data quality directly impacts model quality. Invest time in understanding your data before training.
:::

## Phase 3: Model Development

- 🔬 Experiment with different algorithms
- ⚙️ Perform hyperparameter tuning
- ✅ Implement validation strategies
- 📉 Monitor training metrics
- 🎯 Balance bias-variance tradeoff

## Phase 4: Evaluation & Testing

| Metric Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Performance** | Measure accuracy | Accuracy, F1, RMSE |
| **Business** | Assess real-world value | ROI, conversion rate |
| **Robustness** | Test edge cases | Adversarial examples, out-of-distribution data |
| **Fairness** | Check for bias | Demographic parity, equal opportunity |

## Phase 5: Deployment

:::success Production Readiness
- Infrastructure and resource planning
- API design and scalability
- Model serving and versioning
- Monitoring and alerting
- Rollback procedures
:::

## Building High-Performing Teams

### Key Roles

**Data Scientists** - Model research and experimentation
**ML Engineers** - Production systems and scalability  
**Domain Experts** - Problem understanding and validation  
**Product Managers** - Business alignment and prioritization  
**DevOps/MLOps** - Infrastructure and deployment

:::tip Cross-Functional Collaboration
Align technical solutions with business objectives through regular collaboration between all stakeholders. Set realistic timelines for the experimental nature of AI development.
